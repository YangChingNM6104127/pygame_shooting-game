# pygame_shooting-game

Our group follow professor's toturial and use pygame packages to do this project. Our game is a shooting game related to covid-19 to let people play the game; at the same time, the game arouse people's awareness to covid-19 and precautions.

In the project, I am responsible to some object functions (e.g. falling objects etc.),powerpoint flow and design. Due to time limitation, I believe that thear are a lot of things which we can imporve (e.g. object falling angles, flexibility of moving functions, design patterns and ppt design etc.)

I still learn many things. In one project, communiation is important, if anyone has problem, he/ she must ask others or turn to help, so he/she won't delay the schedule and learn together. Our game follow professor's toturial and refer to other's work. The framework is not totally create by ourselves, but we still try to add our designs and ideas into the game.
